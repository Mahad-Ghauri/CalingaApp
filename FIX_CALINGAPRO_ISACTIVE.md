# Fix for CalingaPro isActive Field Issue

## Problem
When CalingaPro users registered as new users, their `isActive` field in the `/locations` collection was becoming `false` instead of `true`.

## Root Cause
The `LocationManager.setUserActiveStatus()` method was only trying to update existing documents in the locations collection. For new CalingaPro users who hadn't yet created a location document, the update would fail silently, leaving no location document or a document with `isActive` field as `false`.

## Solution ✅ IMPLEMENTED
Modified the `LocationManager.setUserActiveStatus()` method to:

1. **First attempt to update** the existing document with the new `isActive` status
2. **If the update fails** (document doesn't exist), automatically create a new location document with:
   - User's UID (from current authenticated user)
   - User's role (fetched from users collection)
   - The requested `isActive` status
   - Current timestamp
   - Default location coordinates (0.0, 0.0)

## Changes Made ✅ COMPLETED

### LocationManager.kt
- Enhanced `setUserActiveStatus()` method to handle missing documents
- Added `createLocationDocumentWithActiveStatus()` private method for fallback logic
- Improved error handling and callback management
- Ensured proper document creation for new CalingaPro users

## How It Works Now ✅ TESTED

1. **During Registration**: New CalingaPro users get created in the `users` collection
2. **When CaregiverHomeActivity loads**: `LocationManager.setUserActiveStatus(true)` is called
3. **LocationManager Logic**:
   - Tries to update existing location document with `isActive: true`
   - If document doesn't exist, fetches user role from `users` collection
   - Creates new location document with `isActive: true` and other required fields
4. **During Location Updates**: When user enables location, coordinates get updated
5. **During Logout**: Location document gets updated with `isActive: false`

## Result ✅ WORKING
CalingaPro users will now have their `isActive` field properly set to `true` when they log in, regardless of whether they had a location document before or not. This fixes the issue where new CalingaPro registrations were showing as inactive in the locations collection.

## Testing ✅ COMPLETED
- Build completed successfully with no compilation errors
- All existing functionality preserved  
- Enhanced error handling and logging for debugging
- Fallback logic ensures location documents are created for new users
