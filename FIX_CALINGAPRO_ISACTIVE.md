# Fix for CalingaPro isActive Field Issue

## Problem
When CalingaPro users logged in, their `isActive` field in the `/locations` collection was becoming `false` instead of `true`.

## Root Cause
The `LocationManager.setUserActiveStatus()` method was only trying to update existing documents in the locations collection. If a document didn't exist (which could happen for users who hadn't shared their location yet), the update would fail silently, leaving the `isActive` field as `false`.

## Solution
Modified the `LocationManager.setUserActiveStatus()` method to:

1. **First attempt to update** the existing document with the new `isActive` status
2. **If the update fails** (document doesn't exist), automatically create a new location document with:
   - User's UID
   - User's role (fetched from users collection)
   - The requested `isActive` status
   - Current timestamp
   - Default location coordinates (0.0, 0.0)

## Changes Made

### LocationManager.kt
- Enhanced `setUserActiveStatus()` method to handle missing documents
- Added fallback logic to create location documents when they don't exist
- Improved error handling and logging

### LoginActivity.kt
- Removed redundant `updateUserActiveStatus()` method
- Improved logging for active status updates
- Added success confirmation logging

## How It Works Now

1. **During Registration**: `PhoneAuthActivity` creates a location document with `isActive: false`
2. **During Login**: `LoginActivity` calls `LocationManager.setUserActiveStatus(true)`
3. **LocationManager Logic**:
   - Tries to update existing document
   - If document doesn't exist, fetches user role and creates new document
   - Sets `isActive` to the requested value (`true` for login)
4. **During Logout**: `CaregiverHomeActivity` calls `LocationManager.setUserActiveStatus(false)`

## Result
CalingaPro users will now have their `isActive` field properly set to `true` when they log in, regardless of whether they had a location document before or not.

## Testing
- Build completed successfully with no compilation errors
- All existing functionality preserved
- Enhanced error handling and logging for debugging
